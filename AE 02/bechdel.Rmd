## Introduction

In this mini analysis we work with the data used in the FiveThirtyEight story titled ["The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/).

**The Bechdel Test** is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. A movie passes the test if it meets three criteria:
1. It has at least two women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something other than a man

**In this application exercise, you will:**

- Practice data filtering and summarizing
- Calculate return on investment (ROI)
- Create and interpret boxplots
- Use grouping to compare categories
- Practice using inline R code
- Interpret relationships between variables

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes

## Data and Packages

We start with loading the packages we'll use.
```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
```

**What these packages do:**
- **fivethirtyeight:** Contains datasets from FiveThirtyEight articles
- **tidyverse:** Data wrangling and visualization

### About the Data

The dataset contains information on `r nrow(bechdel)` movies released between `r min(bechdel$year)` and `r max(bechdel$year)`. However, we'll focus our analysis on movies released between 1990 and 2013.
```{r filter-years}
bechdel90_13 <- bechdel %>% 
  filter(between(year, 1990, 2013))
```

**What this code does:**
- `filter()`: Keeps only rows meeting a condition
- `between()`: Checks if a value is between two numbers (inclusive)
- Result: Movies from 1990-2013 only

---

## Exercise 1: Count the Movies

How many movies are in our filtered dataset?

**Fill in the blank using inline code:**

There are `r nrow(bechdel90_13)` movies in our dataset.

**Hint:** Use inline R code with `nrow(bechdel90_13)` in your narrative text.

---

## Understanding the Variables

The financial variables we'll focus on are the following:

- `budget_2013`: Budget in 2013 inflation adjusted dollars
- `domgross_2013`: Domestic gross (US) in 2013 inflation adjusted dollars
- `intgross_2013`: Total International (i.e., worldwide) gross in 2013 inflation adjusted dollars

And we'll also use the `binary` and `clean_test` variables for **grouping**:

- `binary`: Whether the movie passed (PASS) or failed (FAIL) the Bechdel test
- `clean_test`: More detailed result (ok, dubious, men, notalk, nowomen)

**Explore the data:**
```{r explore-bechdel}
# View the structure
glimpse(bechdel90_13)

# See how many movies passed vs failed
bechdel90_13 %>%
  count(binary)
```

**How many movies passed the test?** _____

**How many failed?** _____

---

## Analysis

### Binary Bechdel Test Results

Let's take a look at how median budget and gross vary by whether the movie passed the Bechdel test, which is stored in the `binary` variable.
```{r binary-summary}
bechdel90_13 %>%
  group_by(binary) %>%
  summarise(
    med_budget = median(budget_2013),
    med_domgross = median(domgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE),
    med_intgross = median(intgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

**What this code does:**
- `group_by(binary)`: Creates groups for PASS and FAIL
- `summarise()`: Calculates summary statistics for each group
- `median()`: Finds the middle value
- `na.rm = TRUE`: Removes missing values before calculating

---

## Exercise 2: Interpret Binary Results

**Task 2.1:** Which movies have higher median budgets: those that pass or fail the Bechdel test?

**Your answer:**

Movies that ___________ the test have higher median budgets.

**Task 2.2:** Which movies have higher median domestic gross: those that pass or fail?

**Your answer:**

Movies that ___________ the test have higher median domestic gross.

**Task 2.3:** What might explain these patterns?

**Your answer:**

___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________

## Detailed Bechdel Test Results

Next, let's take a look at how median budget and gross vary by a more detailed indicator of the Bechdel test result. This information is stored in the `clean_test` variable, which takes on the following values:

- `ok` = passes test
- `dubious` = unclear whether it passes
- `men` = women only talk about men
- `notalk` = women don't talk to each other
- `nowomen` = fewer than two women

## Exercise 3: Group by Detailed Test Results

**Fill in the blank to group by `clean_test`:**
```{r detailed-summary, eval = FALSE}
bechdel90_13 %>%
  group_by(___) %>%
  summarise(
    med_budget = median(budget_2013),
    med_domgross = median(domgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE),
    med_intgross = median(intgross_2013, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

**Task 3.1:** Which category has the highest median budget?

**Your answer:** _____

**Task 3.2:** Which category has the highest median international gross?

**Your answer:** _____

---

## Return on Investment (ROI)

In order to evaluate how return on investment varies among movies that pass and fail the Bechdel test, we'll first create a new variable called `roi` as the ratio of the gross to budget.

**ROI formula:** (Total Gross) / Budget

Higher ROI = More profitable relative to what was spent
```{r create-roi}
bechdel90_13 <- bechdel90_13 %>%
  mutate(roi = (intgross_2013 + domgross_2013) / budget_2013)
```

**What this code does:**
- `mutate()`: Creates a new variable
- `(intgross_2013 + domgross_2013)`: Total gross (domestic + international)
- `/ budget_2013`: Divide by budget
- Result: ROI of 2 means the movie made twice its budget

---

## Exercise 4: Highest ROI Movies

Let's see which movies have the highest return on investment.
```{r highest-roi}
bechdel90_13 %>%
  arrange(desc(roi)) %>% 
  select(title, roi, year)
```

**What this code does:**
- `arrange(desc(roi))`: Sorts by ROI in descending order (highest first)
- `select()`: Shows only the columns we want

**Task 4.1:** What is the movie with the highest ROI?

**Your answer:** ___________________________________________________________

**Task 4.2:** What is its ROI value?

**Your answer:** _____

**Task 4.3:** Does this movie surprise you? Why or why not?

**Your answer:**

___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________

## Visualizing ROI

Below is a visualization of the return on investment by test result. However, it's difficult to see the distributions due to a few extreme observations.

## Exercise 5: Create Initial Boxplot

**Fill in the blank for the y-axis label:**
```{r initial-boxplot, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bechdel90_13, 
       mapping = aes(x = clean_test, y = roi, color = binary)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Return on investment vs. Bechdel test result",
    x = "Detailed Bechdel result",
    y = "___",
    color = "Binary Bechdel result"
  )
```

**Hint:** The y-axis shows the ROI values.

**Task 5.1:** Why is this plot difficult to interpret?

**Your answer:**

___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________

---

## Extreme Observations

What are those movies with *very* high returns on investment?
```{r extreme-roi}
bechdel90_13 %>%
  filter(roi > 400) %>%
  select(title, budget_2013, domgross_2013, year)
```

**Task 5.2:** How many movies have ROI greater than 400?

**Your answer:** _____

**Task 5.3:** What do you notice about the budgets of these high-ROI movies?

**Your answer:**

___________________________________________________________________________

## Exercise 6: Zoom In for Better View

Zooming in on the movies with `roi < 15` provides a better view of how the medians across the categories compare.

**Fill in the blanks:**
```{r zoomed-boxplot, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bechdel90_13, 
       mapping = aes(x = clean_test, y = roi, color = binary)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Return on investment vs. Bechdel test result",
    subtitle = "Zoomed in to ROI < 15", # Something about zooming in to a certain level
    x = "Detailed Bechdel result",
    y = "Return on investment",
    color = "Binary Bechdel result"
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 15))
```

**Hints for subtitle:**
- Mention that you're focusing on ROI < 15
- Something like "Focusing on movies with ROI less than 15" or "Zoomed in to ROI < 15"

**What `coord_cartesian()` does:**
- Zooms in on the plot without removing data
- `ylim = c(0, 15)`: Shows only y-values from 0 to 15
- Unlike `filter()`, this doesn't remove data, just changes the view

---

## Exercise 7: Interpret the Zoomed Plot

**Task 7.1:** Looking at the zoomed plot, which category has the highest median ROI?

**Your answer:** ok has the highest median ROI

**Task 7.2:** Do movies that pass the Bechdel test (binary = PASS) appear to have higher or lower ROI than those that fail?

**Your answer:**

Movies that pass the Benchdel test seem to have slightly higher return than those that don't
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________

**Task 7.3:** What does this suggest about the financial argument for including women in films?

**Your answer:**

This suggests that female performance doesn't directly harm financial performance because, though they did exist, the differences between the Benchdel and non-Benchdel movies' finances were minimal.

## Exercise 8: Create Your Own Summary

**Task 8.1:** Calculate the mean ROI (not median) for movies that pass vs. fail the Bechdel test.

**Hint:** Use `group_by()` and `summarise()` like we did earlier, but with `mean()` instead of `median()`.
```{r mean-roi, eval = FALSE}
bechdel90_13 %>%
  group_by(binary) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_roi = mean(roi, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

**Mean ROI for PASS:** 7.99

**Mean ROI for FAIL:** 8.36

**Task 8.2:** How do these means compare to the medians we saw earlier? Why might they be different?

**Your answer:**

The mean ROI values are very slightly higher for movies that fail the Benchdel test. The mean and median differ because the mean is more DIRECTLY influenced by extreme high ROI movies while the median is more of a reflection of general, typical movie performance. the difference is that the mean is more exact.

## Exercise 9: Challenge (Optional)

**Create a visualization comparing ROI across years for movies that pass vs. fail the test.**

**Hints:**
- Use `geom_point()` or `geom_line()`
- Put `year` on the x-axis and `roi` on the y-axis
- Color by `binary`
- You might want to filter out extreme ROI values first
- Consider using `geom_smooth()` to show trends
```{r roi-over-time, warning=FALSE}
# Your code here
```

**What trend do you notice?**

## Reflection Questions

**Task:** After completing this exercise, reflect on what you learned.

**What was the most interesting finding about the Bechdel test and movie finances?**

How, using the Benchdel test, some movies achieve more profit than others despite having lower budgets than others.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________

**What was the most challenging part of this exercise?**
The most challenging part was knowing what I'm calculating. I actually mixed up which part of the trend im calculating many times, one common error I made being in comparing the median and mean. Sometimes, when the median accelerated higher than the mean, I thought otherwise. The numbers were just hard to keep track of.
___________________________________________________________________________

**How did zooming in on the plot change your interpretation of the data?**

Zoomed in, I found it a lot easier to compare performances since specific differences points of data were more obvious.

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

- **Error: "could not find function":** Make sure you ran the package loading chunk
- **ROI values look wrong:** Check that you're adding domestic and international gross before dividing by budget
- **Plot doesn't show:** Make sure you ran all previous chunks that create variables
- **NA values in results:** Use `na.rm = TRUE` in your summary functions

**PDF issues:**

- **LaTeX not found:** Install tinytex: `tinytex::install_tinytex()`
- **PDF looks different:** This is normal - focus on content, not formatting

**If you're stuck:**

- Review the walkthrough video
- Check your code against the examples
- Ask on the discussion board
- Attend office hours
